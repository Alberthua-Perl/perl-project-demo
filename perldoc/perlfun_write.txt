    write FILEHANDLE
    write EXPR
    write   Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the specified
            FILEHANDLE, using the format associated with that file. By
            default the format for a file is the one having the same name as
            the filehandle, but the format for the current output channel
            (see the "select" function) may be set explicitly by assigning
            the name of the format to the $~ variable.

            Top of form processing is handled automatically: if there is
            insufficient room on the current page for the formatted record,
            the page is advanced by writing a form feed and a special
            top-of-page format is used to format the new page header before
            the record is written. By default, the top-of-page format is the
            name of the filehandle with "_TOP" appended, or "top" in the
            current package if the former does not exist. This would be a
            problem with autovivified filehandles, but it may be dynamically
            set to the format of your choice by assigning the name to the $^
            variable while that filehandle is selected. The number of lines
            remaining on the current page is in variable $-, which can be
            set to 0 to force a new page.

            If FILEHANDLE is unspecified, output goes to the current default
            output channel, which starts out as STDOUT but may be changed by
            the "select" operator. If the FILEHANDLE is an EXPR, then the
            expression is evaluated and the resulting string is used to look
            up the name of the FILEHANDLE at run time. For more on formats,
            see perlform.

            Note that write is *not* the opposite of "read". Unfortunately.
